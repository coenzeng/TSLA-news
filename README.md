# TSLA-news
A web scraper that tracks Tesla news from Yahoo News. 

Run `webscrape.py` and all of the news (including title, author and date) will automatically be collected in the excel file. I am currently working to see if I can do the same except with Google instead of Yahoo. Google has more complicated architecture which makes it harder to scrape.
