		<p>There are all sorts of camera’s out there. Varying sizes, abilities, shape, colour, material, price, weight, quality, smell, taste, 	personality, environmental resistance, the power to be used as a weapon, and so on. Whether it’s the cheap compact point and shoots, or large capable DSLRs, each have their pros and cons, and most importantly, a purpose. However, we find the advances of mirrorless cameras, allowing them to solve the many past cons, and out doing other cameras. So what exactly are mirrorless camera, what are they capable of, what are the advantages, and what is the driving force that allows them to improve?

	<h2>What Exactly Are Mirrorless Cameras?</h2>

		<p>So what exactly are mirrorless cameras? Like commonly used DSLRs, mirrorless cameras are interchangeable lens cameras, meaning that the lens can be changed, and aren’t fixed on the body. The real difference between the DSLR and MILC (Mirrorless Cameras) is in the name itself. MILC don’t have a mirror that reflects the light to the viewfinder like traditional cameras; instead, they have an imaging sensor that always captures the light/image. Allowing the image to be constantly displayed on the electronic viewfinder or digital display. Due to the lack of mirrors, MILC are compact and small, since the space reserved for the mirrors are longer needed. However, because of this, MILC had some issues in the past.
